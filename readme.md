# Olib

This was one of my very first projects. It was deleted quite a while ago and has been restored (huge thanks to Wayback Machine).

The program was versatile and could be used in a variety of scenarios such as:
- Autoclicker (at the time of testing it is not working)
- Private chat (between computers on the same network, no program to open a server)
- Converter
- Roulette (allowing you to randomly select an item from a list)
- Data parser (probably not working anymore)

The project is archival and will not be developed, imagine it is a museum piece.

This program supports several languages, but the documentation itself is only in Russian.

The source code is preserved in its original state as of October 25, 2019
